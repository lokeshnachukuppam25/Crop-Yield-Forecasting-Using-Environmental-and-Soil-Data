# Project Dependencies and Models

## Libraries Used
The following libraries are used in this project:

1. **Flask**: For creating the web application.
2. **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
3. **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
4. **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and preprocessing.
5. **Pickle**: For saving and loading the trained models and scalers.

## Models Used
The following models are used in this project:

1. **RandomForestClassifier**: A machine learning model from scikit-learn used for crop recommendation.
2. **MinMaxScaler**: A preprocessing tool from scikit-learn used to scale the input features to a specific range.

## Files
